# Final-Java-Project


We are trying to make a game from scratch.

## How to download the code
1. To download the code, press the green code button, then the download zip. 
2. Rename the folder you download to game. 
3. Drag the folder into the source (src) folder in Eclipse. 
4. Drag the images over the JAVA PROJECT FOLDER, NOT THE PACKAGE. (select all of them from the photos folder and drag them all at once).
